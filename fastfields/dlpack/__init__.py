"""fastfields.dlpack: nanobind DLPack bindings to the fastfields-lib C++ lib.

All functions accept any array object exposing ``__dlpack__`` (numpy, torch,
cupy, ...). Tensors marked in-place / as outputs are written through their
DLPack data pointers.

Argument checking
-----------------
This is the raw layer and it stays sharp: it does not reshape, cast, allocate
or copy anything for you. It does reject *structurally* malformed arrays --
a null data pointer, a 0-d array, a vector (multi-lane) dtype, arrays of a
single call spread across different devices -- with a ``ValueError`` naming the
function and the argument, instead of passing them on to the kernels. Shape and
dtype *contracts* (matching ranks, matching batch shapes, ``ndim`` vs. rank)
are enforced one layer down, by ``fastfields-lib``, and also surface as
``ValueError``.

CUDA lifetime invariant
-----------------------
**Every array passed to a CUDA op must be kept alive by the caller until the
stream it was submitted on has been synchronized.**

These bindings are asynchronous on CUDA: a call enqueues work on ``stream`` and
returns immediately, and nothing in this package holds a reference to your
arrays -- the DLPack tensors handed to C++ are plain views over memory the
Python objects own.

If an input, output or temporary is dropped before the stream is synchronized,
its memory goes back to the framework's allocator (CuPy's memory pool,
PyTorch's caching allocator) while a kernel may still be reading or writing
it. The allocator can then hand that same block to an unrelated allocation:
silent corruption, not a crash. The frameworks differ in *when* such reuse is
possible -- PyTorch's caching allocator records the stream a block was used on,
CuPy's pool does not -- so code that happens to work under one is not portable
to the other.

In practice:

.. code-block:: python

    out = cupy.empty_like(inp)
    ff.pull(out, inp, grid, stream=stream.ptr)
    stream.synchronize()        # only now may inp / grid / out be dropped
    del inp, grid               # (or let them go out of scope)

The friendly wrappers satisfy this for you, which is why it is easy to forget:
they submit on the framework's *own* current stream (``fastfields.torch`` via
``_util.stream_ptr``, ``fastfields.cupy`` via ``_util.current_stream_ptr``), so
the framework's ordering rules cover the memory they allocated, and they keep
the operands referenced for the whole call -- ``fastfields.torch`` beyond it,
through autograd's ``save_for_backward``. Calling ``fastfields.dlpack``
directly, or passing a stream of your own, means taking the invariant on
yourself. On CPU it holds trivially -- the calls are synchronous.

    On ELF/Mach-O we preload cpu first, then the hub library, by absolute path
    with ``RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_NOW``: this registers each under its soname so the
    loader reuses these copies when ``_core`` is imported, regardless of the
    RUNPATH baked into libfastfields, and resolving eagerly turns a broken
    build into an error here rather than a crash on the first call.

    ``RTLD_LOCAL`` (the default; spelled out for the record) is deliberate:
    ``_core`` links against ``libfastfields`` directly -- it needs no symbol to
    be visible in the *global* namespace -- so ``RTLD_GLOBAL`` would only serve
    to export every ``ff::`` symbol process-wide, where it can collide with
    another library's. Object *reuse* does not depend on the flag: the loader
    matches an already-loaded object by soname either way.

    On Windows there is no ``RTLD_*`` and no rpath, so we add the lib dir to
    the DLL search path (``_core`` and the hub DLL then resolve their
    dependencies from there) and also load the DLLs eagerly so a missing
    dependency surfaces here rather than as an opaque extension-import failure.
